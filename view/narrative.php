   <p><b><u> NSCLC/EML4-ALK/Fusion</u></b><br>
      ALK rearrangements are N-terminal fusions with other genes.  EML4-ALK fusions are the most common rearrangements and appear in 3-7% of non-small cell lung cancers.  ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase and rearrangements in the gene lead to activation of the kinase (PMID:21277552). ALK fusion proteins stimulate several signaling pathways including AKT and ERK, contributing to tumorigenesis in non-small cell lung cancer (PMID:24060861).

      V600E is an activating mutation in BRAF that enhances kinase activity (PMID:12068308).  BRAF is mutated in 2-5% of non-small cell lung cancers, and BRAF V600E is found in approximately 50-55% of these cancers (PMID: 23401445, 21825258, 21483012).  Constitutively active BRAF provides a mechanism for enhanced activation of the ERK signaling pathway in a manner independent of growth factor stimulation.  This contributes to tumorigenesis in non-small cell lung cancers.

      MET exon 14 skipping mutations promote RNA-splicing-based skipping of MET exon 14 and this leads to activation of MET kinase activity (PMID:7518457, 17079873).  MET exon 14 skipping mutations are found in 3% of non-small cell lung cancers (PMID:25971938).  Loss of exon 14 results in a receptor lacking a juxta-membrane region and this increases stability and activation of MET (PMID:11741535).
